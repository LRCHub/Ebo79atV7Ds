You, hey close your open eyes
cover up your ears inside
the silent signs
of darkness will arise
and you will start to hear
breathing in your own free air
and hear the pul-sing
pounding in your heart
And if you've caught yourself
Won't you let it go now
Run and see
the world is way too
big to hesitate
Hold it tight
your life is way too
short to waste away
Tears will fall
but dreams and love are
waiting where they drop
You will find
A wider world is
waiting here for you
Hey, don't turn the other way
cover up your lonely pain
The hurt you feel
Don't lock it in your heart
And if it hurts your eyes
And if it tries your mind
And if you find
you're losing all control
The wind will blow it through
Won't you let it go now
Here and gone
And all that
we receive will pass away
Come and go
And all we are
made of is made this way
Let it out
Something held inside
may be breaking through
Scream it out
You can scream it out
cause you're beautiful
Morning sun is
in your brown eyes
water glimmering
spring grasses, green fields
Flowers bloom
and scatter round you
night bird calling clear
waking the moonlight
Tears will rise
and fall into
the pain of a caring heart
Sadness hurts
so turn yourself
and look up to the stars
Close your eyes
tonight the light is
blinding in the dark
You will see
us walk into
the breaking dawn of day
